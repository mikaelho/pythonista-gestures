Gestures wrapper for iOS

# Gestures for the Pythonista iOS app
 
This is a convenience class for enabling gestures in Pythonista UI
applications, including built-in views. Main intent here has been to make
them Python friendly, hiding all the Objective-C stuff. All gestures
correspond to the standard Apple gestures.

## Installation

Copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/mikaelho/pythonista-gestures), or

    pip install pythonista-gestures

with [stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash).

## Usage

For example, do something when user swipes left on a Label:
 
    import gestures

    def swipe_handler(data):
        print(fâ€˜I was swiped, starting from {data.location}')
     
    label = ui.Label()
    gestures.swipe(label, swipe_handler, direction=gestures.LEFT)

Your handler method gets one `data` argument that always contains the
attributes described below. Individual gestures may provide more
information; see the API documentation for the methods used to add different
gestures.
  
* `recognizer` - (ObjC) recognizer object
* `view` - (Pythonista) view that was gestured at
* `location` - Location of the gesture as a `ui.Point` with `x` and `y`
  attributes
* `state` - State of gesture recognition; one of
  `gestures.POSSIBLE/BEGAN/RECOGNIZED/CHANGED/ENDED/CANCELLED/FAILED`
* `began`, `changed`, `ended`, `failed` - convenience boolean properties to 
  check for these states
* `number_of_touches` - Number of touches recognized

For continuous gestures, check for `data.ended` in the handler if you are
just interested that a pinch or a force press happened.

All of the gesture-adding methods return an object that can be used
to remove or disable the gesture as needed, see the API. You can also remove
all gestures from a view with `remove_all_gestures(view)`.

## Class: Data

Simple class that contains all the data about the gesture. See the Usage
section and individual gestures for information on the data included. 
Also provides convenience state-specific properties (`began` etc.).

## Methods

## Properties


#### `began (get)`


#### `changed (get)`


#### `ended (get)`


#### `failed (get)`

# Functions


#### `is_objc_type(objc_instance, objc_class)`


#### `gestureAction(_self, _cmd)`


#### `gestureRecognizer_shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer_( _self, _sel, _gr, _other_gr)`


#### `tap(view, action, number_of_taps_required=None, number_of_touches_required=None)`

  Call `action` when a tap gesture is recognized for the `view`.
  
  Additional parameters:
  
  * `number_of_taps_required` - Set if more than one tap is required for
    the gesture to be recognized.
  * `number_of_touches_required` - Set if more than one finger is
    required for the gesture to be recognized.

#### `doubletap(view, action, number_of_touches_required=None)`

  Convenience method that calls `tap` with a 2-tap requirement.
      

#### `long_press(view, action, number_of_taps_required=None, number_of_touches_required=None, minimum_press_duration=None, allowable_movement=None)`

  Call `action` when a long press gesture is recognized for the
  `view`. Note that this is a continuous gesture; you might want to
  check for `data.changed` or `data.ended` to get the desired results.
  
  Additional parameters:
  
  * `number_of_taps_required` - Set if more than one tap is required for
    the gesture to be recognized.
  * `number_of_touches_required` - Set if more than one finger is
    required for the gesture to be recognized.
  * `minimum_press_duration` - Set to change the default 0.5-second
    recognition threshold.
  * `allowable_movement` - Set to change the default 10 point maximum
  distance allowed for the gesture to be recognized.

#### `pan(view, action, minimum_number_of_touches=None, maximum_number_of_touches=None)`

  Call `action` when a pan gesture is recognized for the `view`.
  This is a continuous gesture.
  
  Additional parameters:
  
  * `minimum_number_of_touches` - Set to control the gesture recognition.
  * `maximum_number_of_touches` - Set to control the gesture recognition.
  
  Handler `action` receives the following gesture-specific attributes
  in the `data` argument:
  
  * `translation` - Translation from the starting point of the gesture
    as a `ui.Point` with `x` and `y` attributes.
  * `velocity` - Current velocity of the pan gesture as points per
    second (a `ui.Point` with `x` and `y` attributes).

#### `edge_pan(view, action, edges)`

  Call `action` when a pan gesture starting from the edge is
  recognized for the `view`. This is a continuous gesture.
  
  `edges` must be set to one of
  `gestures.EDGE_NONE/EDGE_TOP/EDGE_LEFT/EDGE_BOTTOM/EDGE_RIGHT
  /EDGE_ALL`. If you want to recognize pans from different edges,
  you have to set up separate recognizers with separate calls to this
  method.
  
  Handler `action` receives the same gesture-specific attributes in
  the `data` argument as pan gestures, see `pan`.

#### `pinch(view, action)`

  Call `action` when a pinch gesture is recognized for the `view`.
  This is a continuous gesture.
  
  Handler `action` receives the following gesture-specific attributes
  in the `data` argument:
  
  * `scale` - Relative to the distance of the fingers as opposed to when
    the touch first started.
  * `velocity` - Current velocity of the pinch gesture as scale
    per second.

#### `rotation(view, action)`

  Call `action` when a rotation gesture is recognized for the `view`.
  This is a continuous gesture.
  
  Handler `action` receives the following gesture-specific attributes
  in the `data` argument:
  
  * `rotation` - Rotation in radians, relative to the position of the
    fingers when the touch first started.
  * `velocity` - Current velocity of the rotation gesture as radians
    per second.

#### `swipe(view, action, direction=None, number_of_touches_required=None)`

  Call `action` when a swipe gesture is recognized for the `view`.
  
  Additional parameters:
  
  * `direction` - Direction of the swipe to be recognized. Either one of
    `gestures.RIGHT/LEFT/UP/DOWN`, or a list of multiple directions.
  * `number_of_touches_required` - Set if you need to change the minimum
    number of touches required.
  
  If set to recognize swipes to multiple directions, the handler
  does not receive any indication of the direction of the swipe. Add
  multiple recognizers if you need to differentiate between the
  directions.

#### `disable(handler)`

  Disable a recognizer temporarily. 

#### `enable(handler)`

  Enable a disabled gesture recognizer. There is no error if the
  recognizer is already enabled. 

#### `remove(view, handler)`

  Remove the recognizer from the view permanently. 

#### `remove_all_gestures(view)`

  Remove all gesture recognizers from a view. 

#### `disable_swipe_to_close(view)`

  Utility class method that will disable the two-finger-swipe-down
  gesture used in Pythonista to end the program when in full screen
  view (`hide_title_bar` set to `True`).
  
  Returns a tuple of the actual ObjC view and dismiss target.

#### `replace_close_gesture(view, recognizer_class)`



## Fine-tuning gesture recognition

By default only one gesture recognizer will be successful. You can prioritize
one over the other by using the `before` method of the returned object.
For example, the following ensures that the swipe always has a chance to happen
first:
    
    panner = pan(view, pan_handler)
    swiper = swipe(view, swipe_handler, direction=RIGHT)
    swiper.before(panner)
    
(For your convenience, there is also a similar `after` method.)

You can also allow gestures to be recognized simultaneously using the
`together_with` method. For example, the following enables simultaneous panning
and zooming (pinching):
    
    panner = pan(view, pan_handler)
    pincher = pinch(view, pinch_handler)
    panner.together_with(pincher)

## Pythonista app-closing gesture

When you use the `hide_title_bar=True` attribute with `present`, you close
the app with the 2-finger-swipe-down gesture. This gesture can be
disabled with:
  
    gestures.disable_swipe_to_close(view)
    
where the `view` must be the one you `present`.

You can also replace the close gesture with another, by providing the
"magic" `close` string as the gesture handler. For example,
if you feel that tapping with two thumbs is more convenient in two-handed
phone use:
  
    gestures.tap(view, 'close', number_of_touches_required=2)

## Other details
 
* Adding a gesture to a view automatically sets `touch_enabled=True` for that
  view, to avoid counter-intuitive situations where adding a gesture
  recognizer to e.g. ui.Label produces no results.
* It can be hard to add gestures to ui.ScrollView, ui.TextView and the like,
  because they have complex multi-view structures and gestures already in
  place.
  
## Versions:
    
* 1.0 - First version released to PyPi. 
  Breaks backwards compatibility in syntax, multi-recognizer coordination and
  removed force press support.
